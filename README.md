# ak-fetch

## üåê Overview

`ak-fetch` is a powerful and flexible tool designed for making bulk `POST` requests to an API endpoints. It allows batching and queuing of requests, concurrency control, retries, and more, making it a robust solution for handling large data operations with ease.

## üöÄ Installation

To get started with `ak-fetch`, install the module using npm:

```bash
npm install ak-fetch
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage
Use ak-fetch directly in your node script or via the command line:

```javascript
const akFetch = require('ak-fetch');
const config = {
        url: 'https://api.example.com',
        data: [...],
		batchSize: 10,
		concurrency: 5,
		delay: 1000,
        // ... other configurations
};

try {
	const responses = await akFetch(config);
	console.log('API Responses:', responses);
} catch (error) {
	console.error('Error:', error);
}
```
command line usage is similar:
```bash
npx ak-fetch --url https://api.example.com './payloads.json' --batchSize 10 --concurrency 5
```
Use `--help` to see all options
